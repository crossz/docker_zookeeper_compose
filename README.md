# Examples

A set of example applications for my own reference and perhaps also useful to
others.

* [five-server-docker](https://github.com/lukeolbrish/examples/tree/master/zookeeper/five-server-docker) - A simple docker example that creates a five server Zookeeper cluster with zkCli access.
* [vertx-configuration](https://github.com/lukeolbrish/examples/tree/master/zookeeper/vertx-configuration) - An example of a vert.x vertical connecting Zookeeper to vert.x with a service that periodically updates a path being watched by the vert.x vertical.
